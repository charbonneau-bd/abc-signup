## Simple Outline and Decisionmaking ##
I left a large amount of the boiler plate code up to annotations and
packages/frameworks (JpaRepository, Lombok) since expansion and business
logic can be implemented later.

The only heavy decision I felt worth making was identifying on SSN when
registering users. I considered the prospect of identifying
them based on SSN and Nationality but from a programming
perspective that's a simple and-condition to slot in and I would rather just
check with legal/POs/PMs if any operational countries can have overlapping
BSNs/SSNs.

The other decision I felt worth implementing was the 'onboarding'
flag to allow us to have multiple channels or status' for users signing up.
I figure some users can be automatically verified, while others may require
human verification (I believe this is the case when signing up for a bank
with a domestic ID versus foreign) so that would allow different channels
to all trigger the flag and send the email.

I also assumed it could allow negative statuses (FRAUD, DENIED, UNDER REVIEW, etc.)
if ever necessary, but for simplicity of current requirements I didn't want to
overcomplicate this functionality.

## Technologies Used And Justifications ##
Lombok - Simplifaction for Spring BOOT Boilerplate options (getters/setters)
PostgreSQL - Familiarity and simple running locally
Docker - Similar to above, plays well with Postgre.
Junit/Jupiter - Familiarity and simplicity.
