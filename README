### Simple Outline on Decisionmaking ###
I left a large amount of the boiler plate code up to annotations and
packages/frameworks (JpaRepository, Lombok) since expansion and business
logic can be implemented later.

One of the major decision I felt worth making was identifying on SSN when
registering users. I considered the prospect of identifying
them based on SSN and Nationality but from a programming
perspective that's a simple and-condition to slot in and I would rather just
check with legal/POs/PMs if any operational countries can have overlapping
BSNs/SSNs.

The other decision I felt worth implementing was the 'onboarding'
flag to allow us to have multiple channels or status' for users signing up.
I figure some users can be automatically verified, while others may require
human verification (I believe this is the case when signing up for a bank
with a domestic ID versus foreign) so that would allow different channels
to all trigger the flag and send the email.

I also assumed it could allow negative statuses (FRAUD, DENIED, UNDER REVIEW, etc.)
if ever necessary, but for simplicity of current requirements I didn't want to
overcomplicate this functionality.

I wanted to add a lot of the required fields as required in the actual User Object
because that tends to provide the most cleanliness for future operations. Namely
use cases where you have multiple forms of User-generation (File imports, mobile app,
web app, etc.) and would leave less clutter in the actual generation process.

### Choice in Technologies Used And Justifications ###
Lombok - Simplifaction for Spring BOOT Boilerplate options (getters/setters)
PostgreSQL - Familiarity and simple for running locally. Allows me UI viewing with pgAdmin.
Docker - Similar to above, and plays well with Postgre. Simple to spin up.
Junit/Jupiter - Familiarity and simplicity, as well as integrating well with annotations.
